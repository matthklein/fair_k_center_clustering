# fair_k_center_clustering

Code for our paper "Fair k-Center Clustering for Data Summarization" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08628).

To try it out and reproduce the boxplots (based on 10 runs) of the experiments of Figures 4 to 6 on artificial data, simply run

```
python experiments_artificial_data.py 
```

If you want to obtain the boxplots based on 50 runs, say, then run

```
python experiments_artificial_data.py 50
```

Similarly in order to reproduce the boxplots of the experiments of Figures 5 and 6 on the Adult data set, run

```
python experiments_adult_data_set.py 50
```
