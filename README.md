# fair_k_center_clustering

Code for our paper "Fair k-Center Clustering for Data Summarization" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08628).

To try it out and reproduce the boxplots (based on 10 runs) of the experiments of Figures 4 to 6 on artificial data, simply run

> python experiments_artificial_data_set.py 

If you want to obtain the boxplots based on 50 runs, say, then run

> python experiments_artificial_data_set.py 50
